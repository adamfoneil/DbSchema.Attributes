This is a very small library of some attributes, enums, and interfaces that I use with [Dapper.CX](https://github.com/adamosoftware/Dapper.CX). I extracted them to a standalone library so that model class projects can use these while keeping a minimal dependency footprint. For example, I don't want model projects to have a Dapper dependency.
